# Car-Price-prediction
The Car Price Prediction project utilizing linear regression is a machine learning endeavor aimed at developing a model capable of estimating the price of a car based on various features and attributes. 
Fundamental supervised learning algorithm, is employed to establish a relationship between the independent variables (car features) and the dependent variable (car price). 
This project involves the following key steps:
1.Data Collection and Preparation
2.Feature Selection
3.Data Splitting
4.Linear Regression Model Building
5.Model Evaluation
Overall, this project aims to develop a predictive tool that assists potential car buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts in estimating a fair price for a given vehicle based on its specifications.
